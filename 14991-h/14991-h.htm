    <h2>SIMPLE AS A "B" "C."</h2>

    <p>DEAR EX-CHANCELLOR WITH A PAST,&mdash;I am sorry to have to
    address you, especially as to you I owe my promotion. But
    matters are coming to a crisis, and the Fatherland is suffering
    from your indiscretions. You are making a great
    mistake&mdash;you are, indeed.</p>

    <p>Now, I ask you, what would you do under the following
    circumstances? Supposing you were in my position, what would
    you do if your predecessor held you up to ridicule, spoilt all
    your favourite diplomatic plans, insulted your employer, and
    made himself generally disagreeable all round? You must know,
    my good Prince, that you are sowing dissension in every
    direction. You are embroiling us with Russia, and running the
    chance of a war with France. Moreover, you are breaking the
    very laws you made for the solitary purpose of meeting the case
    you have raised yourself! So now, with every kindly
    recollection of the past, tell me why I don't arrest you, why I
    don't put you into prison, why I don't break your power once
    and for ever?</p>

    <p class="author">Yours truly,<br />
    VON C&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

    <h4><i>Reply to the above.</i></h4>

    <p>DEAR CHANCELLOR WITHOUT A FUTURE,&mdash;I will answer you
    why you do not arrest me? The simple reason is that you, my
    dear friend, are not BISMARCK.</p>

    <p class="author">And I am, yours truly,<br />
    VON B&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

    course, a very small one. When it goes wrong, it is "at sea."

    fact that he has a distaste for the profession to which you
    belong would be no disqualification. I agree with you that

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I am delighted to observe that some Constant
    Contributors (to other papers, not yours, Sir) are making
    dietetic experiments on Nettles. Perhaps you would allow me to
    mention that Groundsel Salad is a delicious dish, when you get
    used to it, and that a <i>Purée</i> of Chickweed rarely fails
    to create delighted astonishment at a crowded dinner-table.
    Bramble Pie is another excellent recipe straight from Dame
    Nature's Cookery Book. With great care, it is possible to cook
    Thistles in such a way as to make them taste just like
    Artichokes. My family often has these and similar delicacies at
    their mid-day meal, when I am away in the City.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I saw that letter about eating Nettles. Of course
    it's all rot (it you will excuse the expression), but I thought
    it would be fun to try the nettle diet on my Uncle JAMES, who
    never gives me a tip when I go to visit him, although my Mother
    says he's as rich as Creesers, though I don't know who they
    are. So I got one or two good stinging ones (I knew they were
    stingers, because I tried them on Cook first) and cut off
    little bits and put them in Uncle JAMES's sandwiches, which he
    always has for lunch. It was awful larks to watch him eat them.
    I thought he'd have a fit. Then I said good-bye, and I haven't
    been near him since. But I got Cook to take him in a dock-leaf
    from me, and I hope he ate it after the sandwiches. I thought
    it might do him good. I'm going to try nettle sandwiches on a
    boy I know at school, who's a beast. I expect it will give him
    nettle-rash. No more now from</p>

    <p class="author">Yours respectfully,<br />
    TOMMY.</p>

    <p>SIR,&mdash;I frequently recommend patients suffering from
    advanced atrophy to try Nettle Broth. I must say that I am
    myself nettled, when they reply that they prefer the advanced
    atrophy. A good counter-irritant in cases of blood-poisoning is
    a stout holly leaf, <i>eaten raw</i>. In serious cases of
    collapse, if a patient can be got to consume a cactus or a
    prickly pear, the stimulative effect is really surprising. In
    the absence of these products of the vegetable kingdom, a
    hedge-stake, taken directly after a meal, will do equally
    well.</p>

    <h2>UNOPPOSED ELECTION.</h2>

    <p>On Saturday last, being the first day permissible under the
    statute, the nomination of a Knight to serve in Parliament for
    the Shire of Barks, was held in the county town. The
    proceedings were marked by a pleasing unanimity, and an
    outburst of popular enthusiasm which seriously tried the
    resources of the local police. There was only one
    candidate&mdash;TOBY once more M.P. The nomination paper was
    signed by <i>Mr. Punch</i>, Mr. GLADSTONE, Lord SALISBURY, and
    most of the Crowned Heads of Europe.</p>

    <p>The Sheriff inquired if it were desired to nominate any
    other Gentleman. (<i>A Voice</i>&mdash;"<i>I should think
    not!</i>") There being no other response, the Sheriff declared
    the Hon. Gentleman duly elected, and said he would like to be
    permitted to forego his fees, if indeed any were due.</p>

             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>In response to loud calls from the assembled crowd, <i>Mr.
    Punch</i> said he had great pleasure in recommending his young
    friend to the suffrages of this important constituency.
    (<i>Cheers.</i>) He called him young, for though he had been on
    his (<i>Mr. Punch's</i>) establishment for over fifty years, he
    was very little altered. There were some people who never grew
    old (<i>A Voice</i>&mdash;"<i>Bully for you, Mr. Punch!</i>")
    and amongst them he might include his faithful follower, whom
    they had just unanimously re-elected Member for Barks. He
    trusted that in the future, his young friend would pursue the
    course honourably followed by him in the past. ("<i>Hear!
    Hear!</i>") This was the fourth Parliament to which he had been
    elected, and he trusted it would not be the last.
    (<i>Cheers.</i>) He might perhaps allude to a rumour current in
    the ordinary channels of information, which seemed to point to
    their friend's transference to another place. He had the
    authority of TOBY, M.P., to say that, as far as his freedom of
    action is concerned&mdash;and <i>Mr. Punch</i> thanked Heaven
    this is still free England&mdash;(<i>loud
    cheers</i>)&mdash;that prognostication would never be realised.
    The highest honour ever done to his friend, was the selection
    of him by the men of Barks to represent them in the Commons
    House of Parliament. (<i>Renewed cheering.</i>) His fullest
    pleasure was to retain their confidence and to serve them and
    posterity to the utmost extent of his power and opportunity.
    (<i>Disturbance at the rear of the hall; cries of "Put him
    out!" "Sit on 'is 'ead!"</i>) <i>Mr. Punch</i> begged they
    would do no such thing. It would be sure to give way under
    pressure. (<i>Laughter.</i>) In conclusion, he begged to thank
    them for the honour they had done his friend, and he might add,
    themselves.</p>

    <p>There were loud cries for TOBY, M.P., but the Hon. Member
    begged to be excused from making a speech on this occasion. For
    one reason he shrank from coming into competition in the lists
    of platform-speaking with his revered friend and Leader.
    Another thing was, he was really so overcome by the honour just
    done him, that he could not trust himself to speak. He would
    write&mdash;as soon as the new Parliament met.</p>

    <p>After the customary votes of thanks had been carried by
    acclamation, the new Member was hoisted shoulder-high by the
    enthusiastic mob, and carried off to his country residence, The
    Kennel, Barks, where he will remain during the Recess.</p>

    <h3>ELECTION NOTES.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Special Commissioner.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The excitement is getting terrific. In the principal streets
    party flags are waving gaily. In the suburbs every other house
    is hidden beneath vast posters, setting forth the merits of the
    rival parties. The Association of Jam-Dealers held a private
    meeting last night. I was, however, enabled to be present
    having disguised myself as Mr. BLACKFORD, one of the
    Vice-Presidents of the Association, who was taken ill at the
    last moment, and whose letter of excuse for non-attendance I
    managed to intercept. The proceedings opened with prayer, on
    the model of the recent Ulster Convention. After this, the
    discussion began. A series of questions had, it appears, been
    addressed to both Candidates. Here they are:&mdash;</p>

    <p>(1) Will you oppose any attempt to increase the import of
    foreign jam-stuffs?</p>

    <p>(2) Will you support a measure making it compulsory for the
    London Cooperative Stores to sell only Jam manufactured by the
    Bunkham Jam-Dealers' Association?</p>

    <p>(3) Will you oppose any measure calculated to deprive the
    rising generation of one of the necessaries of life in the
    shape of Bunkham Jam? And will you therefore oppose, by all
    lawful Parliamentary means, the use of the domestic rod as a
    punishment for so-called Jam-stealing out of store-room
    cupboards?</p>

    <p>(4) Which do you prefer, gooseberries, raspberries, or
    strawberries?</p>

    <p>(5) Will you advocate a tax of twopence per pot on all jam
    not manufactured in the Bunkham district?</p>

    <p>Both Candidates had sent written replies. But it was
    generally felt that on the answers to the fourth question, the
    vote of the meeting would depend. Bunkham is a district in
    which raspberries and gooseberries are almost exclusively
    grown. Now it is well-known that Mr. PLEDGER, the Liberal
    Candidate, has an almost passionate affection for
    strawberry-jam, and much interest was shown as to whether he
    would be true to his favourite food, or renounce it in order to
    capture votes. I am glad to say that the honourable gentleman
    refused to palter with his convictions. In a manly and
    straightforward answer, he declined to be a party to "a system
    of espionage which had invaded the breakfast table, and might
    go far to make even luncheon intolerable."</p>

    <p>"From my youth up," he continued, "I have never wavered in
    the conviction, that of all known preserves, strawberry-jam is
    both the best, and the most sustaining. I should disgrace
    myself if I were now, at the eleventh hour, to declare a
    preference which I do not honestly feel for gooseberry or
    raspberry."</p>

    <p>This, of course, settled the matter. Mr. TUFFAN declared
    emphatically against the obnoxious strawberry; and the result
    was that the Association, by an enormous majority, decided to
    support him. The Liberals were at first much discouraged, but
    they have now taken heart again. One of their Canvassers, it
    seems, has succeeded in making himself a <i>persona grata</i>
    to a lady who occupies the position of under-housemaid in the
    establishment of the TUFFANS. Through her he obtained an empty
    pot of strawberry-jam, lately consumed by the TUFFAN family.
    This has been fixed upon a long pole, with a placard underneath
    it, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

    <h4 class="sc">Taken from Tuffan's Table!</h4>

    <h4 class="sc">Vote for PLEDGER, and Honest Convictions!</h4>

    <p>And the device is now being carried all over the Town by the
    Junior Liberal Association.</p>

    <p>The polling takes place to-morrow. Both sides are confident,
    but, on the whole, after reviewing all the circumstances of the
    case as impartially as possible, taking into account everything
    that tells for or against both parties, and not forgetting the
    effect produced by the public secession of Mr. HONEYDEW, the
    tobacconist, and Ex-President of the Liberal 500, I am disposed
    to believe in the victory of Mr. PLEDGER; that is to say,
    unless Mr. TUFFAN should manage to secure a sufficient number
    of votes to defeat his opponent.</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p class="author"><i>The Look-out, Sheepsdoor, Kent.</i></p>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,</p>

    <p>My rest at the seaside has done me such a world of good that
    I feel more lazy than ever! But I fear I am in danger of a
    relapse into excitement, owing to a letter I received a few
    days ago from an old military friend of mine, General ELECTION,
    in which he asks me to lend my <i>invaluable</i> assistance in
    "canvassing" for his nephew, the Hon. CHARLIE HULLOTHERE, who
    is standing for Sheepsdoor.&mdash;Ah, how little did I think
    that my reference to "canvas" shoes in my last letter would be
    so prophetic! The General is very gallant, and fully
    appreciates the usefulness of women in canvassing; and, in
    order to be quite "up to date," I have ordered in a large
    supply of gingerbread-nuts and oyster-shells, which I observe
    (see daily papers) are distributed as marks of respect among
    Candidates and their wives!</p>

    <p>Having also heard that a Brass Band is indispensable (the
    more brass it is, the better), I have made friendly overtures
    (<i>musical</i>, of course) to the Sheepsdoor Purveyors of
    Brassharmony, with the flattering result that they now conclude
    every performance with my specially composed "<i>Election War
    Cry</i>"&mdash;the refrain of which is most effective when
    given by a chorus of trained Constituents!&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i2">HullLo-there!</p>

            <p class="i2">HullLo-there!</p>

            <p>He's the man for us;</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i2">We respect him!</p>

            <p class="i2">We'll elect him!</p>

            <p>And we might do wuss!!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In fact, our Candidate is very popular, and is sure to "romp
    in an easy winner"&mdash;which is another puzzling racing
    expression, as, although I've seen plenty of horses indulge in
    a game of romps before the start (notably, <i>L'Abbé Morin</i>,
    in the "City"), they seem to have had more than enough of it
    before the finish!</p>

    <p>I hear from Newmarket, that I missed an extremely pleasant
    week's racing&mdash;and although my selection for the Stud
    Produce Stakes was rather wide of the mark, I fairly hit the
    bullseye&mdash;(what a painful operation this must be for the
    bull)&mdash;in my one "<i>Song from the Birdcage</i>," which I
    warbled in the ear of a racing friend whom I met down here; it
    was <i>à propos</i> of the July Stakes and ran thus:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The night was dark when "<i>Portland Bill</i>"
            escaped by Chesil Beach!</p>

            <p>And hope beat high within his heart, that he the
            goal might reach!</p>

            <p>For "<i>Milford</i>" Haven lies in sight!&mdash;one
            effort and he's there!</p>

            <p>But see!&mdash;At last&mdash;he's caught!&mdash;he's
            passed!&mdash;just by the Judge's Chair!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Which really remarkable prophecy was fully borne out by the
    race, in fact, so close a description might almost have been
    written <i>after the race</i>&mdash;a great compliment to my
    powers of divination!</p>

    <p>Next week takes us to Bibury and Stockbridge. and if this
    hot weather continues, the motto of the Club should be, "<i>Dum
    vivo Bibere</i>"&mdash;or, freely translated&mdash;"<i>Half</i>
    the soda, please!" The race to which I propose to give my
    attention is the Alington Plate, and as I am nothing if not
    thorough, you will see that my tip is influenced by my being at
    the Seaside?</p>

    not knowing the gentleman personally, I would prefer calling
    him BUFFALO WILLIAM or WILLIAM BUFFELLOW, which would be a less
    outlandish name&mdash;and I confess I was astonished, as I
    always thought that Cassocks were Clergymen, or had something
    to do with the Clergy. I suppose I had connected them with
    Hassocks, which are always in Church, and were, I believe,
    invented by Mr. HASSOCK, or Squire HASSOCK, who made all his
    money by keeping a gate on the old Brighton Coach Road. The
    station is still called Hassock's Gate, in his memory. HER
    MAJESTY had all the Cassocks sent down to her at Windsor. They
    must have been quite worn out by the end of the day."</p>

    <p><i>Monday.&mdash;Lohengrin.</i> House full to hear Brother
    JOHN and Madame MELBA. "Please, Sir, Mr. JOHNNIE DE RISKY ain't

    <p>Sir AUGUSTUS calm, impassible. Crisis. If no one turned up,
    he would act the part himself, and, it being Wagnerian music,
    the orchestra would play what of the part had to be played. At
    that moment lounged in Monsieur VAN DYCK, just to see how
    things were going on without him. "I'm a little hoarse
    to-night," quoth VAN DYCK, pleasantly. "Nonsense!" cries Sir
    DRURIOLANUS, cheerily, "a '<i>Van</i>' can never be a little
    hoarse." Much merriment. "DYCK, my boy," continues Sir D.,
    "you've come in the very nick of time&mdash;quite a Devil's
    Dyke, you are,"&mdash;the accomplished vocalist was in
    ecstasies at his Manager's joke,&mdash;"and you shall
    distinguish yourself to-night as <i>Lohengrin</i>!" Oh, what a
    surprise! No sooner said than done. Armour for one ordered
    immediately. ISAAC of York Street goes to work,
    and&mdash;presto!&mdash;VAN DYCK is "ready in case." "Now,"
    asks DRURIOLANUS, "what are we waiting for?"</p>

    <p>"Please, Sir, Madame MELBA isn't here!"</p>

    <p>"MELBA not here to play <i>Elsa</i>!" exclaims Sir
    DRURIOLANUS, immediately adding, with that wit which is always,
    like the British Tar, 'Ready, aye ready!'&mdash;"then we must
    get somebody Else Sir!" and scarcely had the words escaped his
    lips, than Madame NORDICA, who happened to be passing by, sang
    out in an extempore recitative, "<i>Me voici!</i>"
    "<i>Bravissima!</i>" cried Sir DRURIOLANUS. "Saved! Saved!"
    General dance of joy.</p>

    <p>So the Curtain was rung up, and the Opera, with Madame
    NORDICA (<i>vice</i> MELBA) as <i>Elsa</i>, and VAN DYCK
    (<i>vice</i> Little JOHNNIE THE RISKY) as <i>Lohengrin</i>,
    made a big success. House crowded. All's well that ends as well
    as this.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday with Mozart.</i>&mdash;What a good starting idea
    for a Comic Opera would be the notion of making those two types
    of knaves, <i>Leporello</i> and <i>Figaro</i>, meet as
    counter-plotters. Monsieur MAUREL suggests a step in this
    direction, when one night he impersonates the gay Spanish Don,
    and on another he appears as the roguish Italian barber, no
    longer an intriguing bachelor but a jealous bridegroom. Merry
    Melodious MOZART! Old-fashioned he may be, like not a few of
    the best melodies and the best stories. Elegant Countess is
    Madame EMMA EAMES. Can she possibly ever have been
    <i>Rosina</i>, <i>Dr. Bartolo's</i> tricky ward! What a change
    matrimony makes in some folks! Old <i>Dr. Bartolo</i> bears not
    much resemblance to the other <i>Dr. Bartolo</i>, and <i>Don
    Basilio</i>, a kind of Ecclesiastical lawyer, is quite a
    rollicking wag as compared with the <i>Basilio</i> of the
    Barber of Seville. Nothing could be better than the
    <i>Susanna</i> of Mlle. TELEKI, or sweeter than the duet,
    heartily encored, between her and the <i>Countess</i>. EDOUARD
    DE RESZKÉ is a magnificent representative of the
    gloomily-jealous Count, who, having once been the gayest of the
    gay, still retains something of his old sly-boots character in
    private. He is always going wrong, and always being in the
    wrong when found out: a Count quite at a discount, for whom
    there will perhaps be no rest until he is "par." with a family.
    Needless to say, the part was well acted and sung by Brother
    NED, whom a gentleman near me, who "knew all about it," mistook
    for his brother JOHN, and criticised accordingly. As
    <i>Cherubino</i>, Mlle. SIGRID ARNOLDSON is a delightfully
    boyish scapegrace, giving us just that <i>soupçon</i> of
    natural awkwardness which a spoilt sunny Southern lad of
    sixteen, brought up in such mixed society as is represented by
    <i>Count Almaviva's</i> household, would occasionally show when
    more than usually "spoony." Mlle. ARNOLDSON sings MOZART pure
    and simple, without interpolating cadenzas, roulades,
    nourishes, or exercises of musical fireworks, and the audience
    rewarded her artistically simple rendering of "<i>Voi che
    sapete</i>" with an <i>encore</i>, which was as hearty as it
    was well-deserved. Capital House. Parliamentary musicians
    conspicuous by their absence. Ex-M.P.'s represented in a body
    by Sir H-NRY EDW-RDS the evergreen.</p>

    <p>It was reported in the House&mdash;the Opera
    House&mdash;that Sir DRURIOLANUS was standing; but for what
    Constituency, was not mentioned. The rumour was justified by
    his appearing at the Stall entrance, where he stood for some
    time, but as he finely observed, "I am not in search of a
    seat&mdash;in Parliament. No! Let who will make the people's
    laws, give me the bringing out for them of their Operas and
    Pantomimes." So saying, he bowed gracefully to nobody in
    particular (who happened to be talking to him), and, with a
    refreshing wave of the hand, Sir DRURIOLANUS was wafted away
    into the offing, and "lost to sight," while still "to memory
    dear."</p>

    <p><i>Trumpet Note in advance.</i>&mdash;<i>The Trompeter of
    Sakkingen</i> is announced as "in active preparation." Needless
    to say more, as, of course, he blows his own trumpet for
    himself. The question is, will it be a big trump in the hand of
    Sir DRURIOLANUS?</p>

    <p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;<i>Elaine</i> changed her mind, and
    wouldn't come out to-night.</p>

    <p>NEW RENDERING OF "CONSULE PLANCO"&mdash;"CONSULT
    PLANCHETTE."&mdash;If "Planchette" can give such accurate
    information as it appears to have done at Mr. CHARLES WYNDHAM's
    supper-party, and elsewhere, as recounted in the <i>Daily
    Telegraph</i>, why is it not at once put into general
    requisition? Why is there any Parliamentary debating? Why not
    use "Planchette?" Why run any chance of losing on a race, but
    simply "ask Planchette?" Only, by the way, if this were
    universal, and if everyone is to win, who is to lose? Thus
    Planchette would put an end to nearly all speculation.
    Planchette would inaugurate a new era of complete and
    unqualified success. No doubt Mr. CHARLES WYNDHAM consulted
    Planchette before producing <i>The Fringe of Society</i>, and
    is in consequence being amply rewarded for placing his trust in
    Planchette. Failure would be impossible except to the obstinate
    few who should persistently refuse to pin their faith on the
    utterances of "Planchette." But, suppose after doing enough to
    establish her reputation, "Planchette," being feminine and
    therefore "<i>varium et mutabile semper</i>," should suddenly
    deceive her followers, as did <i>Zamiel's</i> seventh charmed
    bullet (which ought always to have been kept up <i>Caspar's</i>
    sleeve&mdash;but <i>Caspar</i> was an idiot), and the Weird but
    Larky Sisters who captivated <i>Macbeth</i>?</p>

    <p>"Trust her not, she's fooling thee, Beware! Beware!" and
    Planchette, the little plank, will make more of her followers
    "plank down" than pick up gold and silver.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
